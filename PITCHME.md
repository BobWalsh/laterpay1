### What is the JAMstack?

- JavaScript: React, Angular, or vanilla JS
- APIs: for CMS, shopping carts, or restricting content
- Markup: regular HTML, templated markup
- ...And only a server to output html files (a CDN).

---
### Advantages

- Speed: everything happens in the browser
- Security: communication limited to defined APIs
- Scaling: cheaper and easier when it's just serving files
---

### Examples

- [City of Boston](https://budget.boston.gov/)
- [Serverless](https://serverless.com/)
- [JAMstack site*](https://jamstack.org/)

(Loaded with JAMstack resources)
---

### Implementing a JAMstack

- A static site generator
- A headless CMS
- A serverless server

---
### Static Site Generators:

- Ruby: Jekyll, Middleman, Octopress
- JavaScript: Hexo, GitBook, [**Gatsby**](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
- ...and other languages

---
### Gatsby has traction

- Written in React.js
- Large and growing community
- Plenty of starter projects and demos
- Uses GraphQL to pull content


---

### What about Content?

#### Do we have to use WordPress? ðŸ˜‚

### No! You have options:

- Markdown
- Connecting to WP, if you must, or
- Use a headless CMS. 

---

#### I like markdown or [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/), but there are plenty closed and open source solutions to [choose from](https://headlesscms.org/).

### Netlify

##### A perfect platform for JAMstack.

##### (and a generous free tier.)

### A quick Demo

#### Gatsby, markdown and Netlify create a blog.

(The Ruby on Rails demo from 2006...)
