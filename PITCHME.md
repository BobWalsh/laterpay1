# The JAMstack and LaterPay 

New ways of doing business.

---

### What is the JAMstack

- JavaScript: React, Angular, or vanilla JS
- APIs: for CMS, shopping carts, or restricting content
- Markup: regular HTML, templated markup
- ...and only a server serving out html files.

---
### Advantages

- Speed: no server means everything happens in the browser
- Security: Communication limited to defined APIs
- Scaling: cheaper and easier when it's just serving files
---
### Examples

- [City of Boston](https://budget.boston.gov/)
- [JAMstack site](https://jamstack.org/)
- [Serverless](https://serverless.com/)
