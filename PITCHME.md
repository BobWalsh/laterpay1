### What is the JAMstack?

- JavaScript: React, Angular, or vanilla JS
- APIs: for CMS, shopping carts, or restricting content
- Markup: regular HTML, templated markup
- ...and only a server serving out html files.

---
### Advantages

- Speed: no server means everything happens in the browser
- Security: Communication limited to defined APIs
- Scaling: cheaper and easier when it's just serving files
---

### Examples

- [City of Boston](https://budget.boston.gov/)
- [Serverless](https://serverless.com/)
- [JAMstack site*](https://jamstack.org/)

(Loaded with JAMstack resources)

### Implementing a JAMstack

- A static site generator
- A headless CMS
- A serverless server

---
### Static Site Generators:

- Ruby: Jekyll, Middleman, Octopress
- JavaScript: Hexo, GitBook, **Gatsby**
- ...and other languages

---
### Gatsby has traction

- Written in React.js
- Uses GraphQL to pull static content
- Large and growing community
- Plenty of starter projects and demos

### What about Content?

#### Do we have to use WordPress? ðŸ˜‚

### No! Use a headless CMS

### I like [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/), but there are plenty closed and open source solutions to [choose from](https://headlesscms.org/).

##### (and a generous free tier.)
